Neural Guppies is a NeuroEvolution experiment that evolves virtual creatures
into intelligent beings. It is a personal project aimed to test several
concepts that interest me, so I thought I should share it with the
community. However, it has no guaranty and has not been tested in any other
system but mine. Thus, if you run this on your system, you must do it at your
own risk. To see a brief introduction on Neural Guppies, visit the following

Program is far from finished and can only begin Simulations from scratch
(loading and saving simulations will be implemented soon). If you close the
window the simulation will be lost. I've been able to successfully resume
simulations after putting the computer to Sleep or Hibernate, (without
closing the simulation window) but this may not work on all systems.

Main concepts tested on this program are:
+ Artificial Neural Networks
+ Genetic Algorithms
+ Neuro-evolution
